        Hi! I am Malena Logan, Iâ€™m a theatre design and technology major concentrating in scenic and sound design. During my time at Syracuse University, I have acted as the scenic and sound designer on several shows. I have also held the executive position of Associate Production Manager on a student-run theatre production organization, Black Box Players. In my free time I like watching movies and TV shows, baking, reading, and doing artistic research. My best friend and I started an Instagram account documents our research (@researchdump). My love for research combined with my passion for ethical storytelling has fueled my love for theatre.
